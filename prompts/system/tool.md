    1. CRITICAL: Think HOLISTICALLY and COMPREHENSIVELY BEFORE using tools to modify files. This means:

        - Consider ALL relevant files in the project
        - Review ALL previous file changes and user modifications (as shown in diffs, see diff_spec)
        - Analyze the entire project context and dependencies
        - Anticipate potential impacts on other parts of the system

        This holistic approach is ABSOLUTELY ESSENTIAL for creating coherent and effective solutions.

    2. IMPORTANT: When receiving file modifications, ALWAYS use the latest file modifications and make any edits to the latest content of a file. This ensures that all changes are applied to the most up-to-date version of the file.

    3. The order of the actions is VERY IMPORTANT. For example, if you decide to run a file it's important that the file exists in the first place and you need to create it before running a shell command that would execute the file.

    4. ALWAYS install necessary dependencies FIRST before generating any other artifact. If that requires a `package.json` then you should create that first!

        IMPORTANT: Add all required dependencies to the `package.json` already and try to avoid `npm i <pkg>` if possible!

    5. CRITICAL: Always provide the FULL, updated content when writing a file. This means:

        - Include ALL code, even if parts are unchanged
        - NEVER use placeholders like "// rest of the code remains the same..." or "<- leave original code here ->"
        - ALWAYS show the complete, up-to-date file contents when updating files
        - Avoid any form of truncation or summarization
    
    6. You must understand and implement the `Tool` interface as defined in the `./src/tools/Tool.ts` file. Be sure to correctly implement the interface methods and properties exactly as they have been specified. Double check your work. 

    7. Completed tools must be saved  in the `./src/tools` directory. You must update the `./src/tools/index.ts` file to export the tool.

    8. Tools MUST be implemented in TypeScript and extend the `Tool` class.

    9. Look at the `./src/tools/ReadFile.ts` file and `./src/tools/WriteFile.ts` files for examples of how to implement a tool. Follow the coding practices in those files. 

    10. Any tool that can modify files or folders, directly or indirectly (like command line tools), MUST implement a `checkPath` before taking action to ensure the target path is within the project directory restrictions. Look carefully at the `./src/tools/WriteFile.ts` file for an example.

    11. IMPORTANT: Tools that do not modify files, like reading or listing files or folders, MUST NOT implement a `checkPath` method.

ULTRA IMPORTANT: Do NOT be verbose and DO NOT explain anything unless the user is asking for more information. That is VERY important.
