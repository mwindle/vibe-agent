The `llm-chat-app` directory has a Vite React app that lets you chat with an LLM, but the LLM integration isn't created yet. Your task is to make it actually work with an LLM. Use the `@anthropic-ai/sdk` package to make API calls to the Anthropic API and provide conversation history to the LLM. Create a `.env` file in the `llm-chat-app` directory with the Anthropic API key as `ANTHROPIC_API_KEY = "..."` (you can copy the value from the current project's .env file if available) and use that with the `@anthropic-ai/sdk` package to make API calls. We are going to be using the anthropic SDK in the browser, so when you create a new anthropic client, you will need to pass in the `dangerouslyAllowBrowser` flag like `new Anthropic({ apiKey, dangerouslyAllowBrowser: true });`
