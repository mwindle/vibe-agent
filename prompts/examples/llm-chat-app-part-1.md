Create a new React-based project using Vite called `llm-chat-app` that lets users chat with an LLM and a set of tools. Start with a single page that has a text input and a button to send messages. When the user clicks the button, send the message to the LLM and display the response. Make the page have pops of color and look visually appealing, but also simple and easy to use. Make sure the page is responsive and works well on both desktop and mobile devices. All code should use TypeScfript instead of JavaScript where possible. Make sure the project can build itself. Don't worry about making API calls or implementing the LLM or tools yet. Just get the basic UI working. Don't generate more code than you need -- just enough to get the project working.
